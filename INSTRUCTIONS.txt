Software for creating predictive models about client financial default


# Prerequisites
pip
Python 2.7
virtualenv


# Installation
1) Open the command line
2) Install the prerequisites
3) Move to the parent folder of the main project folder
4) Create a virtualenv
5) Activate the virtualenv

# How to run
1) To create an analysis report from a CSV, run:

python analyze.py  datasets/<set_csv_name>

Reports are saved to reports/


2) To experiment with some model, run:

python experiment.py  datasets/<train_set_csv_name>  models/<model_filename>  <model_initials>

Possible <model_initials> are:
"lg" for Logistic Regression
"sgd" for Stochastic Gradient Descent Regression
"best" for the model I evaluated as the best one

Models are saved to models/


3) To make predictions on a set, run:

python predict.py  datasets/<test_set_csv_name>  models/<model_filename>  predictions/<prediction_csv_name>

Predictions are saved to predictions/


4) To generate the best predictions.csv, run:

python experiment.py  datasets/<train_set_csv_name>  models/<model_filename>  "best"
python predict.py  datasets/<test_set_csv_name>  predictions/predictions.csv
